### What does it mean?
> In English, it's "loom" -- a piece of equipment for weaving (= making thread into cloth)

### How do I link that name with the streaming service?
> 1. The layout that films are displayed -- a grid, which is made by crossing columns and rows. Can relate that layout to the patterns often made from a loom.
> 2. A film isn't a 120' video. It's built up from multiple things (storyline, content, actors, sound, plot twists,...). Those materials can't be mixed. They have to be connected, like the way a spider builds their web. One by one, step by step.

  
## CI/CD

### Source I learn the steps about CI/CD:

### How it works:
1. I need a GitHub repo first
2. Then links Netlify to that Repo. Netlify uses a thing called WebHooks -- whenever something changes on my repo, WebHooks will send to a notification to Netlify so that Netlify can recognize and decide how to react to that change
3. Initial setup:
	1. (Netlify) set up folder deploy: `build`
	2. (Netlify) command build: `npm run build`
	3. Trigger: whenever I use `push`, Netlify will build and deploy the `build` folder

## Known problems:
- It needs a database to make redirect based on 'loggedin' status works
